# DreamSoft Corporate Website

A bilingual (Turkish and English), responsive corporate website for DreamSoft. It is built with semantic HTML5, CSS3, and modern vanilla JavaScript, with no server-side or paid dependencies.

## Project Structure

```text
dreamsoft/
|-- index.html
|-- css/
|   `-- style.css
|-- js/
|   |-- main.js
|   `-- translations.js
|-- assets/
|   |-- images/

|   `-- logo/
|       `-- logo-mark.svg
|-- favicon.svg
|-- README.md
`-- 404.html
```

## Local Preview

The site has no build step. Open `index.html` directly or serve the folder locally:

```bash
npx serve .
```

The optional command above uses `serve` only for local preview; it is not a website dependency. A local server is recommended when checking browser behavior.

## Publish on GitHub Pages

1. Create a GitHub repository and add the contents of this `dreamsoft` folder at the repository root.
2. Commit and push the files to the default branch, usually `main`.
3. In the GitHub repository, open **Settings > Pages**.
4. Under **Build and deployment**, select **Deploy from a branch**.
5. Select the `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder, then click **Save**.
6. Wait for GitHub Pages to provide the public URL.
7. The canonical and social metadata already use `https://biltekinhamza.github.io/dreamsoft/`. Update them if the repository name or domain changes.

All site file references are relative, so the project works on both user sites and repository subpaths.

## Contact Information

Before publishing, search the project for these placeholders and replace them:

- `info@dreamsoft.example`
- `+90 (___) ___ __ __`
- `Şirket adresi buraya eklenecek`
- `Company address will be added here`
- `#social-placeholder` for LinkedIn and GitHub links
- `https://biltekinhamza.github.io/dreamsoft/` if the repository name or public domain changes

The contact form creates a structured `mailto:` draft and stores no form data. To use Formspree later, create an account, add the endpoint to the form `action`, change the form method to `POST`, and update `js/main.js` to submit via `fetch`. Do not add an endpoint until it belongs to DreamSoft and has been tested.

## Content Updates

- Edit bilingual page copy and generated cards in `js/translations.js`.
- Keep the same object keys in both `tr` and `en` sections.
- Replace sample project concepts under `projects.items`; retain the sample label unless the entries are verified completed work.
- Change colors, spacing, and breakpoints through variables and rules in `css/style.css`.
- Replace `assets/logo/logo-mark.svg` and `favicon.svg` together if the brand mark changes.
- Update the privacy, cookie, and terms text with legal guidance before production use.
